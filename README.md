# upay_alarm
upay_alarm is a scheduled reminder for electrical bill for residential area in my university. This little app is being produced as there is currently no effective way to know when the electric might run out. In the past, student only know the electric is used up when the power of the whole dormitory is cut off, which might impose harmness to some appliances such as desktop computer. To this end, this app is mainly for reminding the user when the electrical bill is lower than a threshold.

An original version of the upay_alarm is a simple python script to use for:
1. inquire the electric surplus for one dormitory regularly (every hour)
2. send email when the electric surplus is lower than a threshold

The script is very simple and can be found here: 

# Reason for this repo
The script can be very easy for people who have prior knowledge with Python and web, but it cannot be expanded to larger use. Most importantly, the school has somehow changed the backend system for checking the electric bill on Wechat Platform, which makes the original script unable to extract the information. Therefore, an upgraded version of the code is presented here. In order to bring the app to the general public, a full-stack app must be created, the user interface must be user-friendly, and the developer should assume that all users have no prior knowledge in programming. 

This is at least what I have learned during my lowest score subject during my year-2: COMP1048 databases and interfaces. **__In fact, this is the course that I obtained the lowest score for my whole undergraduate (shame).__**

So, please do not expect that the aboved program to be perfect, as I am continuesly practicing my full stack capability.
